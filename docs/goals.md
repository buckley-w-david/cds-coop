My goals over the last two terms were very specific to the tasks I was working on here, and my experiences up to the point where I started working on them.

# First Term

During the first few months of my time here, I was lucky to be working with Jason White who was on loan to CDS from Shopify. He helped me gain a better understanding of what areas I would most benefit from working on, and with his help start working on those areas.

> Gain experience and confidence with software testing.

Prior to working here I had only a small amount of experience testing my software. I knew the terminology, but not good ways of putting it into practice.

During the first few months of working here I was on a project which emphasised good testing.  
I learned practices for writing unit tests generally, and tools for implementing those practices with a Python codebase.  
I helped setup and maintain the CI (Continuous Integration) system used on that project and had a part of coming up with end to end tests of the system that ran automatically before every change was merged in to ensure no regressions were introduced.

This experience has completely changed my view of software testing, and had a hugely positive impact on my abilities as a developer.

> Gain a better understanding of best practices when working on a professional software development project.

Up until this job all of the development I have been a part of has been either completely self motivated (personal projects), in the form of school assignments, or as an almost solo endeavor at my previous work place. While this has encouraged the growth of my programming abilities, what it has not developed is my ability to work on a professional product.

This mostly comes in the form of lessons on product management, how to conduct oneself over the course of a sprint, how to participate in sprint planning and retrospective meetings, managing a list of prioritised tasks, things of that nature. 

While I believe I still have more to learn on meaningfully participating in the planning and retrospective meetings, I have succeeded in gaining a better understanding of how to work in such an environment.

> Learn to give back critical and meaningful feedback when participating in code review.

Something I had practically no experience with prior to working at CDS is code review, both receiving and giving it. Development at CDS is a constant feedback loop of small additions and code review. This means that I had lots of exposure to getting and giving code review. 

This has helped improve my ability to read code and have an understanding of the logic, and helped me know how to look for constructive criticism to give others.

# Second Term

During the second term of my time here I was moved onto a project about measuring compliance to web security policy, and had a role with much more operations work than previously, this informed the goals I developed for that time.

> Understand the characteristics, implementation, and purpose of web security technologies (HTTPS, TLS/SSL ciphers and certificates, HSTS).

Going into the project I only had a vague idea of what these technologies actually were and what their implications were. To properly understand the measurement of them I needed a better understanding on them, which I gained from a combination of research and investigating the results of the scanning that was part of the project.

> Learn best practices of building microservice oriented applications (implementation, deployment, and monitoring).

My role on the new project had much more involvement with operations activities (packaging, deployment, etc.). Before this I had only passing involvement with that part of the previous terms project. This forced me to put a lot of effort into researching and working with practices and tooling for the job.

I deep dived on research for how to build, deploy, and monitor applications packaged as set of Docker (A software container solution) images using Kubernetes (A container orchestration platform).

The breadth of knowledge out there is too much for an explanation of a learning goal, but over the last few months I have learned about...

Containerization - Packaging services into black boxes that expose a defined interface for interacting with the outside world.  
Orchestration - Deploying, coordinating, and monitoring a set of containerized services.

Infrastructure as Code - The philosophy that everything about your system should be stored as structured data of some kind for reproducibility and automation.  
Continuous Delivery and Continuous deployment - Two different concepts that relating to the deployment of new updated applications, both aimed at eliminating the painful and error prone act of manual software releases.

> Gain a working understanding of using all three major cloud compute providers (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud).

To help with my investigations on how to manage applications in a sane way, I also wanted to use the experience to gain a familiarity with the major cloud providers to help understand what each offered to help solve the problems of hosting and deploying software.

I have gain a reasonable familiarity with Azure and Google Cloud, but I still don't feel like I am where I want to be with AWS, primarily with their security and permission model.
