CDS is primarily a delivery organization for federal departments.

In practice this means partnering with an organization within the federal government with a particular problem, and helping them build a solution using modern design and development practices. This is not limited to technology, but encompases all stages of work, starting with discovery, where the problem space is explored, to delivery where solutions are implimented with modern development tools and practices.

CDS was formed out of a need to reform the way the Canadian government approaches service delivery, switching from a monolithic waterfall driven process to a more flexible agile approach driven by iterating on discovering and attempting to satisfy user needs. The approach is two part, deliver quality services and help build capacity within existing departments to do the same, both with the goal of improving the services that Canadians recieve in the long term.
